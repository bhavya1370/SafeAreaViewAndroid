# SafeAreaViewAndroid
SafeAreaView for android React Native
If you are a beginer android app developer and use react native, you may have faced the problem of using safe area view for android.

I have tried solving this problem by createing a new .js file called GlobalStyles, then createing a new screen Home.js and adding it to my App.js.
This worked for me and got my text inside the safe area view, you may have to adjust it a bit with respect to the screen you are working on.
