# SafeAreaViewAndroid
SafeAreaView for android React Native
If you are a beginer android app developer and use react native, you may have faced the problem of using safe area view for android.

I have tried solving this problem by createing a new .js file called GlobalStyles, then createing a new screen Home.js and adding it to my App.js.
this got my header just below the icon strip at the top, You'll probably need to adjust it a bit to fit whatever screen you're working on.
